# Lent 2026 

It's pretty weird to post this journal in public this year.

# Day 1. The Desire to Build

Reading 2 Samuel 6–7 confronts me with a striking contrast between intensity and stability, spectacle and promise. Chapter 6 is dramatic and unsettling: Uzzah reaches out to steady the ark and is struck dead (2 Sam 6:6–7), and Michal despises David for dancing before the Lord and is later described as remaining childless (6:23). Chapter 7, by contrast, shifts into covenantal language, where David proposes building a house for God and is instead told that God will build him a “house”: a lasting dynasty (7:11).

My initial reaction to chapter 6 was discomfort. Uzzah’s action appears instinctively protective. The punishment feels disproportionate. 
Yet this resistance may be precisely the point. The ark symbolizes divine presence and untamed holiness. In Numbers and Deuteronomy it was explicitly said that "they must not touch the holy things, or they will die.”
The narrative emphasizes that good intention does not override ordered obedience. Holiness is not stabilized by human impulse. Uzzah’s death functions less as random cruelty and more as a theological statement: divine presence cannot be treated casually.
Michal’s story similarly operates on multiple levels. While her barrenness is painful, the text does not explicitly frame it as direct punishment. It also marks the fading of Saul’s house and the consolidation of David’s line. Political theology and personal tragedy intersect. 

And there's Chapter 7. David was like God I'm gonna build you a house, and God was like no son I'm gonna build *you* a house. I just love this bit. David wishes to build a temple, a visible, concrete achievement. God refuses and instead promises to establish David’s lineage. It resonated with my own internal tension. I find myself craving intensity—creative immersion, physical exertion, passionate engagement. Historically, the moments when I have felt most alive were those in which I pushed myself to extremes: working for hours without pause, running to physical limits. These states produce euphoria, clarity, and a sense of total absorption. Yet they also involve ignoring bodily needs and overriding limits.
I recognize that what feels like “fire” is often a combination of focus, stress hormones, and self-erasure. Intensity becomes a way to silence ambiguity or low-grade emptiness. The body is bypassed in pursuit of meaning. My current life as a student feels abstract and delayed. Reading complex neuroimaging studies does not produce the immediate satisfaction of repairing or cleaning something.

I share David's impulse, to construct something visible. Yet the text insists that covenantal formation precedes visible accomplishment. Stability replaces spectacle. Promise replaces performance. 

Fire is dramatic. Covenant is durable. One is felt immediately; the other unfolds in time.

# Day 2. Valiant, Apparently

I woke up congested again. Throat dry, head heavy, already behind on work. It’s Thursday. The semester is moving whether I am spiritually aligned or not, and for now I feel more aligned with a tissue box than with God.

Psalm 60 opens with, “You have rejected us… you have broken our defenses.” No warm-up, no soft lighting, just straight to abandonment. The psalm assumes that feeling rejected, shaken, and forgotten is part of normal human experience before God, not some fringe, shameful thing. What struck me was the longing. The tone feels less like someone suing God and more like someone knocking on a closed door that used to open more easily. “Have You rejected us?” holds more ache than accusation. I felt seen. Not in a dramatic “God has personally smitten me” way, but in that quieter, structural sense: the relentless feeling that I look impressive on paper and hollow underneath, that one solid shove would be enough to prove I’m not as stable as I pretend to be.

And then the psalm ends with: “With God we shall do valiantly.”

Valiant. A word no one uses in normal conversation unless they’re writing a sermon or a fantasy novel. It’s “bravely determined, especially when things are difficult or when there’s no obvious reason to hope”. It’s putting up a stout-hearted effort, showing strength and resolve, even when the odds or your feelings aren’t on your side. That’s the part that hits me. “Feeling rejected is not the same thing as being rejected”. The psalm doesn’t deny the feeling; it just refuses to let that feeling define the ending.

I don’t need to slay giants. I need to not implode over an assignment. I need to not anesthetize myself with noise and distraction every time the future pokes me in the ribs. I need to not narrate my entire life as a slow-motion failure every time I’m tired. 
For now, “doing valiantly” might be as unglamorous as this: I wake up congested. I show up anyway.

# Day 3. I love you like David loves Jonathan.

_Previously on 2 Samuel 9_: David asks if anyone from Saul’s house is still alive so he can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake. They find Mephibosheth (Jonathan’s son) living in Lo Debar, a nowhere place. He’s disabled, politically dangerous, and from the wrong side of a former war. When he’s brought before David, he falls on his face. He expects judgment. Instead David says, “Do not fear.” Mephibosheth calls himself a dead dog. David restores his land and gives him a permanent seat at the king’s table.

I read 2 Samuel 9 this morning after my Tesco run in the rain. Then I dropped a quick “How are you?” to my friend. After that I trudged through an assignment, and somewhere between her replies and thinking about David and Mephibosheth, it hit me so hard I  couldn’t breathe.

My friend is not doing well. I feel her tired. I’ve been there. I love her. We've been through so much. David and Jonathan had this epic friendship. And that's what I can commit to for her. It's overwhelmingly good. 
David doesn’t wait for Mephibosheth to get it together and come knock on the palace door; he goes looking for someone to show kindness to, for Jonathan’s sake. She feels unworthy, stuck in her head, and I reach out: “You still have a spot at my table, even if you can barely lift your head.”

So she is Mephibosheth. 

I am also Mephibosheth. A dead dog. Don't know what I'm talking about. Mephibosheth’s place at the table isn’t about him knowing the whole Law, having his theology sorted, or walking properly. It’s about David’s covenant with Jonathan. He’s there because of someone else’s promise.

You and I are the lame ones from the wrong family, hiding in Lo Debar. God is the King who decides, “I want you at my table anyway,” because of a promise made in Christ, not because we ticked all the boxes.

# Day 4. Ceasefire

Today I went out in the rain, bought groceries, cooked, and still felt like I had done nothing. I spent the day sick and mostly horizontal, watching the hours blur together. Nothing catastrophic happened. Nothing particularly impressive either. It was an ordinary, unimpressive day, and somehow that felt heavier than it should.

2 Samuel 10 is structurally simple: David offers kindness; it is interpreted as threat; humiliation follows; war escalates. The decisive moment is not violence but suspicion. Once suspicion takes root, escalation feels logical. Humiliation precedes war. That movement, from misreading to self-justified conflict, felt less like a distant historical episode and more like a recognizable pattern. I do not need an enemy to mobilize against; I am capable of recruiting my own thoughts.

There is real kindness in my life, steadiness, food, shelter, health... At the same time, I often experience that steadiness as provisional. Peace does not always register as safety; it registers as something that might be withdrawn. A slow day becomes evidence of deficiency. An unfinished task becomes a referendum on competence. The shift from observation to indictment happens quickly, and once it does, the escalation feels warranted.

The story in 2 Samuel does not imply that humiliation was inevitable. It was chosen. Suspicion transformed a gesture of goodwill into a catalyst for war. That possibility sits with me. I do not have to interpret every imperfection as exposure, to turn discomfort into a campaign. Nothing dramatic resolves here. The question is whether I let vigilance dictate policy. For now, a ceasefire is enough.

# Day 5. Bad Choice Road

2 Samuel 11 feels like watching someone walk straight into a Bad Choice Road ™ with headlights on. It starts so small: “In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war,” David stays in Jerusalem instead of going out with his men, and that one choice to stay comfortable sets the stage for everything that follows. He’s not doing any openly awful thing yet, he’s just not doing what he’s supposed to do, and that absence of obedience creates space for temptation to grow quietly in the background. Then he’s on the roof, he sees Bathsheba bathing, and instead of turning away, he lingers; instead of stepping back, he steps closer. Every part of this could have been an exit: go back inside, pray, sleep, anything, but he chooses curiosity over holiness. He asks who she is, and when he hears she’s “the wife of Uriah,” one of his own loyal men, that should have been his slap in the face. But instead of stopping there, he keeps walking down the slope, telling himself one more move, one more workaround, one more way to manage the situation. By the time Bathsheba is pregnant and David is arranging Uriah’s death with a letter he signs himself, it’s like watching a moral car crash in slow motion. The text offers no inner monologue, only momentum. And at the end, the verdict is spare: “the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.”

I can feel that same slipping Jimmy energy in my heart sometimes, looking for a clever workaround instead of a clean, honest confession, trying to manage consequences instead of admitting the mess. David had so many off-ramps and ignored them, and I know I do the same: ignoring the nudge to stop, pushing away conviction, promising myself “I’ll fix it later” while I go one step further down. His story is scary because it shows how far a person who loves God can fall when they stop taking those early warning signs seriously. 

Show me the roof before the affair, the lazy spring before the battlefield, the small compromise before the disaster, and give me the courage to take the exit You’re giving me while it still looks small.

# Day 6. Show me where I'm hiding

Reading 2 Samuel 12 today was heavy. Nathan doesn’t debate or lecture; he tells a simple story and then drops the line that cuts through all David’s self‑protection: “You are the man.” Then David's kid died. Bit harsh again innit? What did the kid do? Born in sin. Too bad for you. I can imagine the kid was perhaps just sick, but people ascribed meaning to it. We meaning making machines. I also realize that I don’t really have a Nathan right now. No one in my actual life who can look at my patterns, tell me a story, and then say, “That’s you,” without getting pushed away. I miss that. I miss being called out in a way that doesn’t destroy me but also doesn’t let me pretend.

Psalm 51 sounds different with all that in mind. It's not poetry from a safe distance. “Have mercy on me, O God… wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.” No excuses, no spin, just a request to be cleaned from the inside out. Repentance is different from self‑hatred. It’s finally stopping the dodge, telling the truth, and asking for a new heart when you can’t manufacture one.

I'm still in the aftermath of yesterday's reading. I don’t go to war when it’s time; I idle. I don’t do what I know I’m supposed to do, and that empty space fills up fast with old coping, secrecy, and avoidance. I don't want to "feel forgiven". I want to steer away from old coping. I want to act so that I can tell the truth about how I act. Show me where I’m hiding before it compounds. And help me become the kind of person a real Nathan could actually reach.

# Day 7. Raging with Tamar and every Tamar since

Today’s chapter is a horror story inside a “holy” family. Power is used for rape, a woman is silenced and left desolate, a brother answers injustice with murder, and a father who is supposed to embody justice becomes “very angry” and then does nothing. The people closest to God’s promises still act like this. 2 Samuel 13 shows David as a king whose calling and conduct no longer align; he is “a man after God’s own heart”, AND a father whose response to horror is utterly inadequate. He is anointed to protect the vulnerable and restrain evil, yet his passivity creates the conditions for further violence. Silence becomes permission, and unresolved wrong turns into bloodshed. 

I feel irritated, trapped, cold, and alone reading it, surrounded by stories of people blowing up their own families. My default responses are familiar: anger with no action, or fantasies of burning everything down. I see David’s paralysis and Absalom’s revenge as distorted mirrors of those impulses. I also recognize the quieter inheritance, the instinct to “be quiet, don’t make a fuss”, in the way Tamar is told to keep the devastation contained. 

At the same time, the wider narrative of David’s life shows that God’s commitment to him does not rest on flawless performance. David’s earlier sins with Bathsheba and Uriah, and now his failure to seek justice for Tamar, are confronted by prophetic words and followed by real consequences, but not by the cancellation of God’s covenant. God neither ignores David’s sin nor abandons His promise. That combination is hard to hold together: God takes injustice and abuse with full seriousness, and yet still chooses to work through compromised people.

This chapter, then, sits at the intersection of two truths: that leadership and family roles carry real moral responsibility, and that even those chosen by God may fail grievously in those responsibilities. It warns against treating anger as a substitute for justice and exposes the damage done when those with power choose avoidance over action. And in the middle of all that wreckage, it leaves open this uncomfortable hope: that God’s purposes are not undone by our failures, even while He refuses to pretend they are anything less than what they are.

# Day 8. No Joab

2 Samuel 14 reminds me of Mike Ehrmantraut's line: No half‑measures. Joab is brilliant and manipulative, the man behind the curtain. He sees that David is stuck about Absalom and doesn’t confront David directly. Instead, he hires a woman, scripts a story, and pushes the king into a decision he wouldn’t make on his own. It works, but only halfway. Absalom comes back to Jerusalem, yet David refuses to see his face. Mercy without truth. Proximity without healing. A son in the same city as his father, but not at peace.

I recognize myself in this half‑reconciliation. I attend the lecture, admire the teacher, and feel something in me say, “That’s the kind of clinician and communicator I want to be,” but then I pull back into apathy and exhaustion. I consider going to the climbing session to find a top rope buddy, then recoil at the thought of noise and people. I sit near what I desire and then hover at the edge, like Absalom in Jerusalem, present but estranged.

Sometimes I wish there were someone who scripts the hard words, stages the confrontation, and makes me do the right thing without me having to own it. I ask for advice and structure because it feels easier if someone wiser hands me the story and then says, “Now apply it to yourself.” There is a place for counsel and wise friends, but Joab is a warning: some things cannot be subcontracted. David still has to decide what to do with Absalom’s face. No one can do that for him.

I am training for a vocation where people will look to me when decisions must be made. There will be no Joab or wise woman in the corner, feeding me lines. Patients will not wait while I outsource my courage. Today’s reading presses the question: where am I hoping someone else will force my hand, instead of telling the truth and acting on it myself?

# Day 9. What's Absalom sin?

Today I was wrecked: PMS, post‑viral, headache humming in the background. I still made it to class, cycled, went to Sams training, and didn’t buy the 10pm fried chicken.

I read 2 Samuel 15 and honestly don’t know what to do with Absalom. He’s furious about what happened to Tamar and I’m with him on that. David is passive and shady and half‑does everything: kind of forgives, kind of keeps his distance, kind of rules, kind of doesn’t. Part of me thinks, “Yeah, of course the son with a working sense of justice and some ambition is going to go for the throne. If he can get there strategically, what exactly is the sin?” Is he lying to the people at the gate? Or is he genuinely planning to give them the justice David never bothered to show? Where’s the line between necessary strategy when you’re weaker and straight‑up manipulation? I don’t know. Right now it just feels like Absalom has a point, David still has a calling, and I don’t know how to hold both without wanting to backstab David myself.

What’s the real difference between strategy and theft of hearts? When does righteous anger turn into using other people as pieces? And what does it mean to follow a God who remembers both the wars and the Bathsheba chapter, even when the official record (1 Chronicles) doesn’t?
