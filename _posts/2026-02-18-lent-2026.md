# Lent 2026 

It's pretty weird to post this journal in public this year.

# Day 1. The Desire to Build

Reading 2 Samuel 6–7 confronts me with a striking contrast between intensity and stability, spectacle and promise. Chapter 6 is dramatic and unsettling: Uzzah reaches out to steady the ark and is struck dead (2 Sam 6:6–7), and Michal despises David for dancing before the Lord and is later described as remaining childless (6:23). Chapter 7, by contrast, shifts into covenantal language, where David proposes building a house for God and is instead told that God will build him a “house”: a lasting dynasty (7:11).

My initial reaction to chapter 6 was discomfort. Uzzah’s action appears instinctively protective. The punishment feels disproportionate. 
Yet this resistance may be precisely the point. The ark symbolizes divine presence and untamed holiness. In Numbers and Deuteronomy it was explicitly said that "they must not touch the holy things, or they will die.”
The narrative emphasizes that good intention does not override ordered obedience. Holiness is not stabilized by human impulse. Uzzah’s death functions less as random cruelty and more as a theological statement: divine presence cannot be treated casually.
Michal’s story similarly operates on multiple levels. While her barrenness is painful, the text does not explicitly frame it as direct punishment. It also marks the fading of Saul’s house and the consolidation of David’s line. Political theology and personal tragedy intersect. 

And there's Chapter 7. David was like God I'm gonna build you a house, and God was like no son I'm gonna build *you* a house. I just love this bit. David wishes to build a temple, a visible, concrete achievement. God refuses and instead promises to establish David’s lineage. It resonated with my own internal tension. I find myself craving intensity—creative immersion, physical exertion, passionate engagement. Historically, the moments when I have felt most alive were those in which I pushed myself to extremes: working for hours without pause, running to physical limits. These states produce euphoria, clarity, and a sense of total absorption. Yet they also involve ignoring bodily needs and overriding limits.
I recognize that what feels like “fire” is often a combination of focus, stress hormones, and self-erasure. Intensity becomes a way to silence ambiguity or low-grade emptiness. The body is bypassed in pursuit of meaning. My current life as a student feels abstract and delayed. Reading complex neuroimaging studies does not produce the immediate satisfaction of repairing or cleaning something.

I share David's impulse, to construct something visible. Yet the text insists that covenantal formation precedes visible accomplishment. Stability replaces spectacle. Promise replaces performance. 

Fire is dramatic. Covenant is durable. One is felt immediately; the other unfolds in time.

# Day 2. Valiant, Apparently

I woke up congested again. Throat dry, head heavy, already behind on work. It’s Thursday. The semester is moving whether I am spiritually aligned or not, and for now I feel more aligned with a tissue box than with God.

Psalm 60 opens with, “You have rejected us… you have broken our defenses.” No warm-up, no soft lighting, just straight to abandonment. The psalm assumes that feeling rejected, shaken, and forgotten is part of normal human experience before God, not some fringe, shameful thing. What struck me was the longing. The tone feels less like someone suing God and more like someone knocking on a closed door that used to open more easily. “Have You rejected us?” holds more ache than accusation. I felt seen. Not in a dramatic “God has personally smitten me” way, but in that quieter, structural sense: the relentless feeling that I look impressive on paper and hollow underneath, that one solid shove would be enough to prove I’m not as stable as I pretend to be.

And then the psalm ends with: “With God we shall do valiantly.”

Valiant. A word no one uses in normal conversation unless they’re writing a sermon or a fantasy novel. It’s “bravely determined, especially when things are difficult or when there’s no obvious reason to hope”. It’s putting up a stout-hearted effort, showing strength and resolve, even when the odds or your feelings aren’t on your side. That’s the part that hits me. “Feeling rejected is not the same thing as being rejected”. The psalm doesn’t deny the feeling; it just refuses to let that feeling define the ending.

I don’t need to slay giants. I need to not implode over an assignment. I need to not anesthetize myself with noise and distraction every time the future pokes me in the ribs. I need to not narrate my entire life as a slow-motion failure every time I’m tired. 
For now, “doing valiantly” might be as unglamorous as this: I wake up congested. I show up anyway.

# Day 3. I love you like David loves Jonathan.

_Previously on 2 Samnuel 9_: David asks if anyone from Saul’s house is still alive so he can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake. They find Mephibosheth (Jonathan’s son) living in Lo Debar, a nowhere place. He’s disabled, politically dangerous, and from the wrong side of a former war. When he’s brought before David, he falls on his face. He expects judgment. Instead David says, “Do not fear.” Mephibosheth calls himself a dead dog. David restores his land and gives him a permanent seat at the king’s table.

I read 2 Samuel 9 this morning after my Tesco run in the rain. Then I dropped a quick “How are you?” to my friend. After that I trudged through an assignment, and somewhere between her replies and thinking about David and Mephibosheth, it hit me so hard I  couldn’t breathe.

My friend is not doing well. I feel her tired. I’ve been there. I love her. We've been through so much. David and Jonathan had this epic friendship. And that's what I can commit to for her. It's overwhelmingly good. 
David doesn’t wait for Mephibosheth to get it together and come knock on the palace door; he goes looking for someone to show kindness to, for Jonathan’s sake. She feels unworthy, stuck in her head, and I reach out: “You still have a spot at my table, even if you can barely lift your head.”

So she is Mephibosheth. 

I am also Mephibosheth. A dead dog. Don't know what I'm talking about. Mephibosheth’s place at the table isn’t about him knowing the whole Law, having his theology sorted, or walking properly. It’s about David’s covenant with Jonathan. He’s there because of someone else’s promise.

You and I are the lame ones from the wrong family, hiding in Lo Debar. God is the King who decides, “I want you at my table anyway,” because of a promise made in Christ, not because we ticked all the boxes.
