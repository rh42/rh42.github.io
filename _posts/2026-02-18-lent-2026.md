It's pretty weird to post this journal in public this year.

# Day 1. The Desire to Build

Reading 2 Samuel 6–7 confronts me with a striking contrast between intensity and stability, spectacle and promise. Chapter 6 is dramatic and unsettling: Uzzah reaches out to steady the ark and is struck dead (2 Sam 6:6–7), and Michal despises David for dancing before the Lord and is later described as remaining childless (6:23). Chapter 7, by contrast, shifts into covenantal language, where David proposes building a house for God and is instead told that God will build him a “house”: a lasting dynasty (7:11).

My initial reaction to chapter 6 was discomfort. Uzzah’s action appears instinctively protective. The punishment feels disproportionate. 
Yet this resistance may be precisely the point. The ark symbolizes divine presence and untamed holiness. In Numbers and Deuteronomy it was explicitly said that "they must not touch the holy things, or they will die.”
The narrative emphasizes that good intention does not override ordered obedience. Holiness is not stabilized by human impulse. Uzzah’s death functions less as random cruelty and more as a theological statement: divine presence cannot be treated casually.
Michal’s story similarly operates on multiple levels. While her barrenness is painful, the text does not explicitly frame it as direct punishment. It also marks the fading of Saul’s house and the consolidation of David’s line. Political theology and personal tragedy intersect. 

And there's Chapter 7. David was like God I'm gonna build you a house, and God was like no son I'm gonna build *you* a house. I just love this bit. David wishes to build a temple, a visible, concrete achievement. God refuses and instead promises to establish David’s lineage. It resonated with my own internal tension. I find myself craving intensity—creative immersion, physical exertion, passionate engagement. Historically, the moments when I have felt most alive were those in which I pushed myself to extremes: working for hours without pause, running to physical limits. These states produce euphoria, clarity, and a sense of total absorption. Yet they also involve ignoring bodily needs and overriding limits.
I recognize that what feels like “fire” is often a combination of focus, stress hormones, and self-erasure. Intensity becomes a way to silence ambiguity or low-grade emptiness. The body is bypassed in pursuit of meaning. My current life as a student feels abstract and delayed. Reading complex neuroimaging studies does not produce the immediate satisfaction of repairing or cleaning something.

I share David's impulse, to construct something visible. Yet the text insists that covenantal formation precedes visible accomplishment. Stability replaces spectacle. Promise replaces performance. 

Fire is dramatic. Covenant is durable. One is felt immediately; the other unfolds in time.
